# 🖼️ Final AI Image Classification Project  

## 🧾 Overview  
This repository contains my **final project for AI image classification**. It focuses on training and evaluating deep learning models on image datasets, with the goal of classifying images into predefined categories.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
| File / Folder | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `radar-signal-classification/training_set/` | Contains the training dataset (images) used for model training. |
| `22119129-22119067.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. |
| `22119129_22119067.pdf` | Final report of the project. |
| `22119129_22119067.pt` | Saved PyTorch model checkpoint. |
| `test.ipynb` | Notebook for testing the trained model. |

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** PyTorch, Torchvision, NumPy, Matplotlib
