Final AI Image Classification Project
🧾 Overview

This repository contains my final project for AI image classification. It focuses on training and evaluating deep learning models on image datasets, with the goal of classifying images into predefined categories.

📂 Repository Structure
File / Folder	Description
radar-signal-classification/training_set/	Contains the training dataset (images) used for model training.
22119129-22119067.ipynb	Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
22119129_22119067.pdf	Final report of the project.
22119129_22119067.pt	Saved PyTorch model checkpoint.
test.ipynb	Notebook for testing the trained model.
🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
